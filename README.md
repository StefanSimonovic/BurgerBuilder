## Project info

This project is created following Udemy course from Maximilian Shwarzmuller <br />
"React - The Complete Guide(incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)".

The idea is that you have a visual representation of burger and the ingredients, <br />
that you can control, after which you can go to the checkout page and buy your custom made burger.

For the backend service I am using Firebase and the communication is done with axios as a HTTP client.
